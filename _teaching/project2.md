**Project summary.** Universities are often celebrated for their positive contributions to urban development, but these benefits may be accompanied by negative impacts linked to gentrification and housing market transformation. Existing research is often based on single-case studies or small, non-representative samples.

Using consistent census tract boundaries, this working paper compares socioeconomic indicators in university-adjacent tracts to the rest of the urban area from 1981 to 2016 across Canadian Census Metropolitan Areas and tracted Census Agglomerations with universities. The analysis covers 19 indicators grouped into four themes: housing markets, population age, education/employment characteristics, and social diversity. Differences are most pronounced in large and medium urban areas; in smaller urban areas, university neighbourhoods changed substantially in the early 2000s and have become increasingly distinct, resembling university neighbourhoods in larger urban areas.
