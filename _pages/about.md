Welcome to my website.

I am a Ph.D. student in Urban Planning at McGill University (Montréal, Canada) and Data Lead at Curbcut. My research combines spatial data science, causal inference, and machine learning to study how policies, institutions, and market dynamics shape neighbourhood change and housing outcomes. I work with census and administrative datasets at fine spatial scales and use designs such as difference-in-differences and event studies, alongside panel and spatial econometric models.

My ongoing projects include: (1) estimating the effects of social housing development on rents and housing supply in Montréal using tract-level longitudinal data and quasi-experimental designs; and (2) evaluating the local development effects of public spending and major public infrastructures in Québec and Canada using long-run census data linked to geocoded investments.

At Curbcut, I structure and document housing databases and automated data pipelines for analysis and visualization products. This includes integrating heterogeneous sources—such as census indicators, CMHC series, and internally collected or local datasets (e.g., development projects and zoning-related data)—into reproducible, versioned workflows.
