excerpt: "This study examines the spatiotemporal economic and social transformations associated with proximity to major university campuses in Canada’s eight largest urban regions from 1981 to 2016. Using quinquennial census data, we develop spatial panel regression models to analyze four dimensions of neighborhood change at the census tract level: rents, young adult populations, immigrant populations, and bachelor’s degree holders. Our findings reveal that census tracts closer to universities exhibit significantly higher average rents, larger young adult populations, greater immigrant populations, and a higher proportion of university-educated residents. However, we find that these relationships vary greatly over time, indicating more complex dynamics than previously understood. The concentration of young adults, immigrants, and educated individuals near universities has only emerged since the 1980s, while rents in these areas have increased more slowly compared to other metropolitan regions, suggesting convergence rather than gentrification. Additionally, the growing proximity of the immigrant population to universities reflects a longstanding trend rather than a recent development associated with international student enrollment. These results highlight the dynamic nature of university-neighborhoods’ relationships and underscore the significance of these institutions in shaping the economic and social geographies of Canadian urban regions."
